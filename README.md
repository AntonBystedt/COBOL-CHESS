# COBOL-CHESS
# INTRODUCTION:

WELCOME TO THE CHESS PROGRAM IN GNU COBOL! THIS PROGRAM IS AN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CLASSIC CHESS GAME, WRITTEN IN THE COBOL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND COMPATIBLE WITH THE GNU COBOL COMPILER.

DUE TO THE NAMING SCHEME OF THIS PROGRAM, THE KNIGHT HAS BEEN RENAMED TO HORSE. THIS IS BECAUSE TWO LETTERS ARE USED TO DENOTE A PIECE. FOR EXAMPLE 'WQ' IS WHITE QUEEN, 'BP' IS BLACK PAWN AND SO ON. THE KINGS ('BK' AND 'WK') WOULD THEREFOR HAVE THE SAME NAMES AS THE KNIGHTS ('BK' AND 'WK'). DUE TO THIS, THE KNIGHT HAS BEEN RENAMED TO HORSE AND HAVE THE VALUES 'BH' AND 'WH'.

# FEATURES:
